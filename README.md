# channelizer-discord-bot
During these WFH (Work From Home) times, Discord helps to collaborate and execute projects with fellow mates. Hence private channels became a necessity for working on different projects in a server with other people. The process of setting up permissions and creating roles for the same proved too hectic for me to not automate. 
Thus, became Channelizer.
Gone are the days of creating private roles, numerous text and voice channels and setting up permissions for them, Channelizer does it all for you.
